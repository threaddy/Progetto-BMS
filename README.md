Here is a script to send data from a BMSino to a pc via serial interface, to read 6 lihium cell voltages, temperatures and activate balancing. Multiple BMSinos can be used in daisy chain to control more than 6 cells.

BMSino is a totally open-source (HW & SW) Battery Management System shield for Arduino Uno. The source file of the board is available on Circuit Maker: https://circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Erwins-Fluffy/BMSino made by Lucast85
Started from https://github.com/prashantvpanchal/AD7280a_SPICommunication to communicate with the AD7280 of BMSino
